		User Story #1: My chart should have a title with a corresponding id="title".

		User Story #2: My chart should have a g element x-axis with a corresponding 
		id="x-axis".

		User Story #3: My chart should have a g element y-axis with a corresponding 
		id="y-axis".

		User Story #4: Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with the 
		corresponding class="tick".

		User Story #5: My chart should have a rect element for each data point with 
		a corresponding class="bar" displaying the data.

		User Story #6: Each bar should have the properties data-date and data-gdp 
		containing date and GDP values.

		User Story #7: The bar elements' data-date properties should match the order 
		of the provided data.

		User Story #8: The bar elements' data-gdp properties should match the order 
		of the provided data.

		User Story #9: Each bar element's height should accurately represent the 
		data's corresponding GDP.

		User Story #10: The data-date attribute and its corresponding bar element 
		should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis.

		User Story #11: The data-gdp attribute and its corresponding bar element 
		should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis.

		User Story #12: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a 
		corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.

		User Story #13: My tooltip should have a data-date property that 
		corresponds to the data-date of the active area.
